# runBPM

## About
runBPM is a BPM finder website, with data sourced from  API. The idea comes from a struggle that many runner experience - trying to find the right song to match their heartbeat. BPM, or beats per minute, is a great way to make sure that you are keeping the right pace when running and that you are not over exerting yourself.

BPM is not used by just runners, however. Musicians, dancers, video editors, and many other people use BPM as a unit of measure. We wanted to target runners specifically with a more athletic, simple feel. Many BPM Finders out there are geared towards musicians and dancers who care about more parts of the song than an athlete would. 

## Design Choices

### Overall Design Choices 

- The athlete as the customer
- Focus is on runners, but acknowledging that anyone can use this.
- Emphasis on simple colors and minimalism to translate well across devices
- Fewer choices of “what to do” within the app to focus on the main goal of this product

### Added Features to Increase Design Aesthetic

- Dark mode
- Including a ‘favorites’ section on the homepage to make it less empty
