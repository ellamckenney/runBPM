  <h4>The Idea</h4>
  <div class="message">
    <p>runBPM comes from the struggles of trying to create BPM-based playlists. One great 
        way to keep your stride and heart rate in check while running is by matching your 
        measurement with a song’s BPM (beats per minute).

        While runBPM is targeted at runners in particular, we encourage all people to use this 
        if they are curious about the BPM of a song. Maybe you want to make sure you have the right 
        beats for a dance, or maybe you want to start learning about music. Maybe you’re just 
        curious how many beats per minute Not Like Us has (Spoiler alert, it’s 101 - approved by 
        the American Heart Association for CPR!). However you use runBPM, we’re glad you’re here. </p>
